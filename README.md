# Educational System Malpractice and Negligence on the real purpose basis of education
## Introduction
The education system of the Philippines has been highly influenced by the country’s colonial history.  That history has included periods of Spanish, American and Japanese rule and occupation.  The most important and lasting contributions came during America’s occupation of the country, which began in 1898.  It was during that period that English was introduced as the primary language of instruction and a system of public education was first established—a system modeled after the United States school system and administered by the newly established Department of Instruction.
