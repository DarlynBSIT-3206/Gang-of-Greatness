# Educational System Malpractice and Negligence on the real purpose basis of education
## Introduction
The education system of the Philippines has been highly influenced by the country’s colonial history.  That history has included periods of Spanish, American and Japanese rule and occupation.  The most important and lasting contributions came during America’s occupation of the country, which began in 1898.  It was during that period that English was introduced as the primary language of instruction and a system of public education was first established—a system modeled after the United States school system and administered by the newly established Department of Instruction.

Although the Philippine system of education has long served as a model for other Southeast Asian countries, in recent years that system has deteriorated. This is especially true in the more remote and poverty-stricken regions of the country.  While Manila, the capital and largest city in the Philippines, boasts a primary school completion rate of nearly 100 percent, other areas of the country, including Mindanao and Eastern Visayas, have a primary school completion rate of only 30 percent or less.  Not surprisingly, students who hail from Philippine urban areas tend to score much higher in subjects such as mathematics and science than students in the more rural areas of the country.

The Philippine educational system has followed multitudes of parameters and ideas from the previous implementation of the educational system that we adopt in the Americans until our educational system was influenced by different methods and approaches. But this project will be focusing not just on the sudden changes in the educational system in our country, instead, we will be focusing on the malpractice and negligence of the real purpose of the education system. 

The primary focus of the classroom teacher is on the planning, preparation, and teaching of programs to achieve specific student outcomes. The classroom teacher engages in critical reflection and inquiry in order to improve knowledge and skills to effectively engage students and improve their learning. As the classroom teacher gains experience the employee’s contribution to the school program beyond the classroom increases. All classroom teachers may be required to undertake other duties in addition to their rostered teaching duties provided the responsibility is appropriate to the salary range, qualifications, training and experience of the teacher. But as we further do the research, we found out that, teachers nowadays are failing to do the main purpose of their profession due to other requirements mandated by the Department of education for the documentation and paper related works that somehow taking away their opportunity to focus on teaching.
