# Project Title: Educational System Malpractice and Negligence on the real purpose basis of education
## Introduction
The history of the Filipino colonial era has had a profound impact on the education system in the Philippines. This history encompasses periods of Spanish, American, and Japanese authority and occupation. The most significant and long-lasting contribution occurred during America's occupation of the nation, which began in 1898. English was selected as the primary language at this time, and the public school system was founded for the first time. It is managed by the newly founded Ministry of Education, which is designed after the American school system.

Although the Philippine education system has long served as an example for other Southeast Asian countries, it has recently degraded. This is especially evident in the country's most distant and impoverished regions. While Manila, the Philippines' capital and largest city, has a nearly 100 percent primary school completion rate, other portions of the nation, such as Mindanao and Eastern Visayas, have a primary school completion rate of 30 percent or less. Not surprisingly, pupils from the Philippines' metropolitan areas outperform those from the country's more rural parts in topics like mathematics and science.

The Philippine educational system has followed multitudes of parameters and ideas from the previous implementation of the educational system that we adopt in the Americans until our educational system was influenced by different methods and approaches. But this project will be focusing not just on the sudden changes in the educational system in our country, instead, we will be focusing on the malpractice and negligence of the real purpose of the education system. 

In the current climate of setting professional standards for the teaching profession, the question arises as to whether schools have a duty of care to students with regard to educational outcomes(Russo, 2018). The fundamental responsibility of the classroom teacher is to organize, prepare, and teach programs to accomplish certain student objectives. Critical reflection and inquiry are used by the classroom instructor to increase knowledge and skills in order to successfully engage students and improve their learning. The employee's contribution to the school program outside of the classroom grows as the classroom instructor develops experience. All classroom instructors may be expected to do additional responsibilities in addition to their rostered teaching duties, providing that the obligation is proportionate to the teacher's wage range, qualifications, training, and experience. But as we further do the research, we found out that, teachers nowadays are failing to do the main purpose of their profession due to other requirements mandated by the Department of education for the documentation and paper related works that somehow taking away their opportunity to focus on teaching. 

## Problem Statement 
Our educational system has been plagued by conflicts over the years that have continued unabated to this day. Among the plethora of difficulties, two have managed to stand out as particularly important: quality and relevance. The Philippines' biggest educational challenge is a short-sighted policy of forsaking education quality and quantity for economic considerations. There are several issues confronting the country's educational system, one of which is the diminishing quality of education. It's unusual to hear college professors complain about the caliber of students that attend their classes. They decry the children's inability to write even a single correct sentence, let alone a whole paragraph. Private schools have been chastised for producing half-baked graduates who eventually join the ranks of the nation's educated unemployed. All of these are indicators of inadequate educational quality. A variety of causes have contributed to poor educational standards. According to studies and fact-finding commissions, the deteriorating quality of education is due to the following factors: a low government budget for education; poor teacher quality; poor school management; poor school facilities such as laboratory and library facilities; a poor learning environment; the content of the curriculum; insufficient books and science equipment; a poor method of instruction; classroom shortages, and others.

There are other elements to consider while evaluating a teacher's abilities. Teachers are given starvation salaries, but that is only part of their tragic story. Teachers' jobs are made more difficult by decaying classrooms, overcrowded courses, and a lack of teaching resources, among other factors. Aside from classroom education, teachers are responsible for a range of time-consuming and tedious chores that have nothing to do with teaching. The DECS's National Research and Development Center for Teacher Education listed 76 extracurricular activities that public school teachers participate in. Operation Timbang, census taking, tax awareness drive, Clean and Green Drive, Alay-Tanim, Alay-Lakad, fundraising efforts, lining the streets to greet foreign guests, and so on are examples of such events. To accomplish all of this, instructors are required to work two or three hours of extra every day. They are also required to report on weekends, holidays, and even during their annual vacation time.

The main task of the teacher in the education process should focus on the learning progress and the deliverance of lessons for the competencies of the students. But as we dig deeper into the role of the teacher in the community, we will realize the non-related things a teacher still needs to perform. Encountering teachers having the same issue and complaining about the paper-related compliance they need to submit also takes a huge amount of time they could use in improving the teaching-learning process. 

## Significance of the Proposed Study
Through the comprehensive exploration of this study on the real purpose basis of education, The influence of Malpractice and Negligence will be unraveled, emphasized, scrutinized. Moreover, this research will elucidate how this principle prevailed on the Educational System in the Philippines.

In this regard, this study will give awareness to society on how this Malpractice and Negligence affects the Educational System. Moreover, through the analysis made by this study, educational entities and institutions will have a new approach on how to teach and provide high quality education.

In addition to this, the analysis that is presented in this study will convey valuable information for future research and may lead to a more in-depth analysis of it.

## Methods
This section discusses the practical " Who, What, Where, When, and to what extent" of the research project at hand. More precisely, it refers to the researchers' methodical design of a study in order to ensure that the results are valid and trustworthy and that they address the research's aims and objectives. The method chosen for this study is a descriptive analysis method.

Teachers should be merely focusing on teaching students the main task. As there is allotted time for work things should be accomplished within that given time schedule. Due to unsudden things and extra work they need to accomplish the graph below clearly shows the data that most of the teachers usually do their extra work in the evening. Teachers are very known for “take-home” which indicates the work they bring home to do. This graph clearly states that the 8 hours of work period are not enough for the things they need to accomplish. That most of the teachers suppose to a lot more time on teaching rather than other activities, but this thing cannot be a real-life classroom setting. Being a student seeing things my teachers are doing and having a teacher in the family this data we have way back in 2013 is just an illustration nowadays. But regardless of the workloads, we can clearly see the things or lists they need to do.

## Expected Output
The study's purpose is to address the world's most pressing education-related issue. The fundamental objective of the study is to produce expected outcomes for the following topic: Educational System Malpractice and Negligence on the real purpose of education that students and teachers can benefit for the betterment of their way of having quality education.The expected outcomes are:

Having the financial means to pay for their child's education
All students have access to school supplies
Classrooms are available to accommodate new students and teachers.
Students and teachers will have a higher chance of learning how to use these tools through technical hands-on learning.
