# Educational System Malpractice and Negligence on the real purpose basis of education
## Introduction
The education system of the Philippines has been highly influenced by the country’s colonial history.  That history has included periods of Spanish, American and Japanese rule and occupation.  The most important and lasting contributions came during America’s occupation of the country, which began in 1898.  It was during that period that English was introduced as the primary language of instruction and a system of public education was first established—a system modeled after the United States school system and administered by the newly established Department of Instruction.

Although the Philippine system of education has long served as a model for other Southeast Asian countries, in recent years that system has deteriorated. This is especially true in the more remote and poverty-stricken regions of the country.  While Manila, the capital and largest city in the Philippines, boasts a primary school completion rate of nearly 100 percent, other areas of the country, including Mindanao and Eastern Visayas, have a primary school completion rate of only 30 percent or less.  Not surprisingly, students who hail from Philippine urban areas tend to score much higher in subjects such as mathematics and science than students in the more rural areas of the country.
